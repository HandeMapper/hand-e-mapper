Project Background and Overview
-------------------------------
This project involves a joint collaboration between the Computer Science Department at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo and the Intel Corporation. Our contact from Intel Corp., provides the primary focus and objectives for this project which involves the use of a basic web camera to detect the gesture of "throwing" virtual objects on a computer and/or mobile device. This focus requires the use of computer vision software to attempt to detect the generalized gestures of throwing.
